Building an advanced local LLM RAG pipeline by combining dense embeddings with BM25

-  Author : Rahul11

-  The BM25 algorithm was a very popular search algorithm
-  This is also called semantic search because the encoder transforms text into a high-dimensional vector representation (called an embedding) in which semantically similar texts are close together
-  Hybrid search is flexible and can be adapted to tackle a wider range of information needs.
-  Hybrid search combines multiple search techniques to enhance the retrieval of information.
  Typically, it integrates traditional keyword-based search with semantic search capabilities, allowing for both exact matches and understanding of context and intent.

Key Features:

-  Keyword Search: Uses traditional indexing methods to find documents containing specific terms.
-  Semantic Search: Leverages natural language processing (NLP) to understand the meaning behind queries, enabling more relevant results even when exact terms aren't used.
-  Ranking: Combines different algorithms to improve the ranking of search results, considering both relevance and user intent.
-  Multi-Modal Capabilities: May include the ability to search across various content types (text, images, etc.) and incorporate data from different sources.

Benefits:
-  Improved Relevance: By understanding user intent, hybrid search can deliver results that better match what users are actually looking for.
-  Greater Flexibility: It accommodates various types of queries, whether they're straightforward or more complex.
-  Enhanced User Experience: Provides a more intuitive and satisfying search experience, as users can find what they need more efficiently.
